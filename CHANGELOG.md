####Release 1.1.1

The time pickers have now been replaced with ClockPickers by [weareoutman](https://weareoutman.github.io/clockpicker/). It is essentially a clock style time picker based on Bootstrap and jQuery.  

####Release 1.0.1

**Critical**
* There was a bug in the previous version where time was not being properly formatted and hence blanks were being stored in the database. This is now fixed.

**Minor**
* Included now is a footer that links back to the Github repo.
* The navbar is fixed to the top and will remain as you scroll. 
* There is only one submit button that is fixed to the navbar.
