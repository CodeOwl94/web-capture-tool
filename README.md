#Web Capture Tool 
---------------------------
This web capture tool was built to assist experimenters at the System Health Lab, University of Western Australia record data. However, the tool was also built with the intention that the general public can use it for their needs as well. As such, it is well documented and all the source code written is available. 

##Installation
-------------------------
The source code for this tool is a simple cobbling together of HTML, PHP and jQuery scripts. Bootstrap was used for formatting purposes however it is linked to using [CDN](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/) so you will not need to download the Bootstrap source code. Furthermore, the jQuery library is simply the bundle provided by [Google](https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.2.2/jquery.min.js).
